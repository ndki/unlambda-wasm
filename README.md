Not yet an unlambda-to-wasm compiler but i'm hoping to get there.

Currently the javascript interpreter is fairly fast, though. It's on par with
inazz.jp/unlambda/, and has the advantage that it uses no mutual recursion.
I hope to get Adventure by irori to compile and run its first line in < 1s
on my machine (currently 1.05s-1.30s).
