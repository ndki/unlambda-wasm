Not yet an unlambda-to-wasm compiler but i'm hoping to get there.

Currently the javascript interpreter is fairly fast, though. It's much faster
than the other javascript interpreter i've tried.
I hope to get Adventure by irori to compile and run its first line in < 1s.

Currently, however, there is no garbage collection, so memory use is actually
linear with execution time lol. But i have several things in mind.
